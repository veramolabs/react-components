The goal of this project is to create a set of reusable React components that can be used to render W3C Verifiable Credentials, Verifiable Presentations, DID Documents, etc.

These components should implement rendering rules that are being [proposed by the working group at RWOT & IIW](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/rendering-vcs-snapshot-9-27-22.md).
